# Information on Batches of CO2 in Seawater Reference Material

#   Dickson_CRM/batches.html
#
# These reference materials were prepared at the Scripps Institution
# of Oceanography of the University of California,  San Diego with
# support from the US National Science Foundation and (in the early
# years) from the US Department of Energy. For detailed information
# about an individual batch click its link to obtain a PDF copy of
# the batch certificate. Contact co2crms@ucsd.edu for information
# about the availability of such reference materials.
#
# Notes
#  * Provisional values
#
#  A) Total alkalinity was not measured when the batch was
#     originally certified; the total alkalinity value is based on
#     measurements performed on archived samples of the batch.
#  B) The measured values of total dissolved inorganic carbon and of
#     total alkalinity changed with time, probably due to the
#     effects of microbial growth in the bottles. This batch was not
#     certified as reference materials.
#  C) This batch was a synthetic solution of sodium bicarbonate in
#     sodium chloride prepared directly in the holding tank by di-
#     luting concentrated, filtered solutions of the two salts with
#     deionized (Milli-QÂ®) water. The salinity value was assigned so
#     as to allow the correct density at 20oC to be calculated using
#     the density-salinity relationship for sea water.
#  D) Total alkalinity was not measured as archived samples were not
#     available; value is expected to have been stable.
#  E) This batch was used as a basis of a collaborative study for
#     the analysis of total dissolved inorganic carbon by coulometry.
#  F) This batch was prepared in England by using North Atlantic
#     near surface water. All analyses were performed, as with all
#     previous batches, in the laboratories of Andrew G. Dickson and
#     Charles D. Keeling.
#  G) This batch was certified for total dissolved inorganic carbon
#     using a Ruska electronic constant-volume manometer rather than
#     the mercury column manometer for Batches 1-47.
#  H) This batch was used in a collaborative study involving the
#     analysis of CO2 in air from glass ampoules.
